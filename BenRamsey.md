I'm a web application architect from Nashville, TN, and VP of Engineering at <a href='http://moontoast.com/'>Moontoast</a>, where I work with an incredibly talented team, building products like the Distributed Store and Moontoast Impulse. I've been working in this space for many years, and I enjoy using my experience and love for web development to lead teams of developers to build great things on the Web.<br>
<br>
I've spoken at many conferences, such as OSCON, ZendCon, php|tek, and International PHP Conference, I've co-authored and contributed to several books, including <i>php|architect's Zend PHP 5 Certification Study Guide</i>, and I've written for magazines like <i>php|architect</i> and <i>International PHP Magazine</i>.<br>
<br>
My involvement in the PHP community has also led to my work with the Atlanta PHP User Group and, now, the Nashville PHP User Group. In 2011, I organized the first <a href='http://phpcon.org/'>PHP Community Conference</a> in Nashville.<br>
<br>
When not working with the Web, I enjoy trying all different kinds of craft beer. I'm currently studying for the Beer Judge Certification Program exam.<br>
