<h3>RESTLess: Why you should stop using REST</h3>
RESTful web services are all the rage these days, with a proliferation of software frameworks, books (even "cookbooks"), and hype. Yet many purportedly "RESTful" web APIs don't actually adhere to all the constraints Roy Fielding laid out in his thesisâ€”and there is also no shortage of REST purists who will happily point that out. People want to turn any API into a RESTful web service, even where that may not be necessary. Has REST jumped the shark?<br>
<br>
In this talk, we'll revisit the original architectural constraints Fielding described. Each of these is meant to induce certain characteristics in a system, but what if your system doesn't actually need those properties? What happens if we relax those constraints? Are there simpler options available than a fully RESTful architecture? Places where REST are actually the right choice may be less common than we might think. If REST is a hammer, this talk will hopefully make us much better at recognizing actual nails.<br>

<tr><td> <i>Abstract</i> </td><td> Most REST frameworks abstract away HTTP details, but this is actually not what we want. Developers need to understand and use HTTP as the native language of the web; using a framework without understanding this is like using a calculator without understanding how to do arithmetic with pencil and paper. In my experience, a traditional web MVC framework provides everything needed for good REST implementations and results in simple, easy-to-understand server logic. </td></tr>
