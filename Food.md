Below is a rough outline of the possible food schedule for 2011

# Special Meal Requests #
If you have any meal requirements (Kosher, Halal, Vegitarian, Vegan, etc.) please post your name and you preference here.

  * [MikeAmundsen](MikeAmundsen.md): Vegetarian (Dairy is OK) and, yea, fruit would be cool.
  * [JonMoore](JonMoore.md): no particular dietary requirements, but I'll put in a plug for having fresh fruit available at some of the snack points
