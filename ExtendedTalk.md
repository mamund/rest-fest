# Extended Talks #

Extended talks can run from 30-60 minutes based on the topic and the speaker's materials. Extended talks (referred to as "Selected Talks" in some messages) will be picked and scheduled ahead of time from the list of posted abstracts. The schedule for Extended Talks will be settled the week before the event and notices will be sent to all.

At REST Fest this year, the actual length of the talk may be constrained by the time available. If we have lots of great talks, we might need to shorten the presentation time. If only a few people propose Extended Talks, we'll be able to allocate more time to each talk.

If, for some reason, your proposed Extended Talk is not selected, you will be invited to offer it as a FiveInFive talk. That way you can present your material and use the Breakout Sessions to follow up with the details.
