#summary Describes the Five-In-Five talk format

= FiveInFive Talks =

A FiveInFive talk is really the same as a "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Talk Lightning Talk]." The idea is to prepare just five slides and complete the talk in five minutes. 

The thought is that everyone has at least five minutes of a talk in them!

For REST Fest this year, all FiveInFive talks will be delivered as a group and attendees will be able to follow up w/ the speaker in the Breakout sessions to dig deeper into the topic in a less formal setting.
