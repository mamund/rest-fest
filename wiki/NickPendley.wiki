Nick develops software from his home in Columbus, Ohio for a small Raleigh, North Carolina-based company that specializes in collecting, analyzing, and reporting performance data and other metrics in soldiers, astronauts, executives, etc.  The current architecture includes a XUL client, a POX .net HTTPListener application server, PostgreSQL database, and some old Windows Mobile/PocketPC applications.  

While developing mobile applications on different platforms, the company is redesigning the web service in .net so that will be easier to use and develop against.  

In short, <b>Nick is a REST novice here to learn about REST and how its principles could benefit this architecture change</b>.

===Proposed Talks===
|| _Title_ || *XUL* ||
|| _Level_ || Beginner, FiveInFive ||
|| _Abstract_ || A high level overview of [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/xul XUL], its usage scenarios, and lessons learned from three years of XUL application development.  ||
|| _Slides_ || Not yet available ||
|| _Title_ || *Case Study: Can REST Rescue Gideon? ||
|| _Level_ || Beginner, FiveInFive ||
|| _Abstract_ || A high level overview of Gideon, the application server I helped develop and how I (a REST novice) think that REST can redeem it from its weaknesses.  It may not be very educational for you but it will explain why I am asking so many questions and it will likely surface the knowledge gaps I have.   ||
