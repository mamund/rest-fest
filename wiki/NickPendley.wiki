Nick develops software for a small company in Raleigh, NC that specializes in collecting, analyzing, and reporting performance data and other metrics in soldiers, astronauts, executives, etc.  The current architecture includes a XUL client, a POX .Net HTTPListener web service, PostgreSQL database, and some old Windows Mobile/PocketPC applications.  While developing new mobile applications on different platforms, we are attempting to create a better web service is .net that will be easier to use and develop against.  Nick is here to learn about REST and how its principles could benefit this architecture change.
