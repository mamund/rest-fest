Nick develops software from his home in Columbus, Ohio for a small Raleigh, North Carolina-based company that specializes in collecting, analyzing, and reporting performance data and other metrics in soldiers, astronauts, executives, etc.  The current architecture includes a XUL client, a POX .net HTTPListener application server, PostgreSQL database, and some old Windows Mobile/PocketPC applications.  

While developing mobile applications on different platforms, the company is redesigning the web service in .net so that will be easier to use and develop against.  

In short, <b>Nick is a REST novice here to learn about REST and how its principles could benefit this architecture change</b>.
