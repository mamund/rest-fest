Based on [InitialAgenda]

 # Keynote and session speakers selected ahead of time. (how?)
 # Hack Room Pitches where folks stand up and suggest projects for the Hack Room(s)
 # Lightning talks are 5 slides/5 mins, anyone can talk, suggest pre-posting. Interesting things get a breakout session (vote w/ your feet?)
