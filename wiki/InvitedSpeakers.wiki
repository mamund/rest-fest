#summary People we should consider for an ExtendedTalk slot

= Invited Speakers =

Last year we had a handful of 30min talks for an [ExtendedTalk]. One thought is to reach out to a handful of folks this year and invite them to offer a talk for one of these slots. This has a potential to bring some really talented/interesting folks to the event and create some interaction between these speakers and the attendees.

Another goal of this idea is to attract 'new' thinking and ideas to the event and offer key folks a chance to talk on more speculative topics, try out new material, etc. Hopefully, this can be a kind of 'new idea' space for our community.

We proly have between four and eight of these slot available. If we get lots of RSVPs we can consider creating 'tracks' this year to give everyone a chance to speak.

BTW - We will still expect all attendees to present at least one [FiveInFive] talk this year.

Everyone should add names (and links) to this list and we can discuss a 'shortlist' soon and send out invites.

Here are some possible names for the InvitedSpeakers list:
  * BrianSletten
  * MikeKelly
  * GlennBlock
  * Henrik Fristik
  * SamRuby
  * JonMoore
  * StuCharlton
  * MichaelHausenblas
  * IanSRobinson
