Hi, my name is David Zuelke (_ZÃ¼lke_, actually, but don't bother with the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_umlaut umlaut]). I'm from Munich, Germany, where I run [http://www.bitextender.com/ Bitextender]. I'm also the lead developer of [http://www.agavi.org/ Agavi], an application framework for PHP, which I've used for many, many years (should be over ten years of PHP now). My nick on IRC is _Wombert_.

When not hacking on PHP projects and the Agavi framework, I like to fiddle with REST-related things, CouchDB, HTTP and MapReduce/Hadoop.
