#summary Keith Casey's page

= Keith Casey =

I've been a developer for a decade developing in Java, PHP, and related technologies. I've done everything from leading distributed teams through major product releases to replaces tabs with spaces.. or spaces with tabs. Whatever.

I work in the Austin technology community to better connect developers, companies, and groups with similar goals. Further, I am a lead contributor to web2project - web-based project management system.
