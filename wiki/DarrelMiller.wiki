===Proposed Talks===
|| _Title_ || *application/vnd.tavis.commandlist+xml - Partial updates via commands* ||
|| _Level_ || Intermediate, FiveInFive ||
|| _Abstract_ || PUT works great when you are updating files and images.  It is not so easy to use when you are updating shared resources stored in a relational database.  This talk will introduce the notion of using a list of commands to perform partial and transient updates.  I cover issues like validation, progressive disclosure, error handling and undo/redo.  I will also attempt to justify why I believe this is not just another way to tunnel RPC over HTTP.   ||
