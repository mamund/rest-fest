===Proposed Talks===
|| _Title_ || *There is No Dana, Only XUL* ||
|| _Level_ || Beginner, FiveInFive ||
|| _Abstract_ || A high level overview of [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/xul XUL], its usage scenarios, and lessons learned from three years of XUL application development.  ||
|| _Slides_ || [https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0BxiuO8rsJVX7M2YyZjNmM2UtYzY2Ni00ZTU1LWI2MWUtZGY0ZjEwZWIwNTMy&hl=en | Here] ||


|| _Title_ || *Case Study: Can REST Rescue Gideon? ||
|| _Level_ || Beginner, FiveInFive ||
|| _Abstract_ || A high level overview of Gideon, the application server I helped develop and how I (a REST novice) think that REST can redeem it from its weaknesses.  It may not be very educational for you but it will explain why I am asking so many questions and it will likely surface the knowledge gaps I have.   ||
