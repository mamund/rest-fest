I'm a web application architect from Nashville, TN, and VP of Engineering at [http://moontoast.com/ Moontoast], where I work with an incredibly talented team, building products like the Distributed Store and Moontoast Impulse. I've been working in this space for many years, and I enjoy using my experience and love for web development to lead teams of developers to build great things on the Web.

I've spoken at many conferences, such as OSCON, ZendCon, php|tek, and International PHP Conference, I've co-authored and contributed to several books, including _php|architect's Zend PHP 5 Certification Study Guide_, and I've written for magazines like _php|architect_ and _International PHP Magazine_.

My involvement in the PHP community has also led to my work with the Atlanta PHP User Group and, now, the Nashville PHP User Group. In 2011, I organized the first [http://phpcon.org/ PHP Community Conference] in Nashville.

When not working with the Web, I enjoy trying all different kinds of craft beer. I'm currently studying for the Beer Judge Certification Program exam.
