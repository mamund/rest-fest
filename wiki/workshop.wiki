Presented by [http://amundsen.com/blog Mike Amundsen] ([http://twitter.com/mamund @mamund])

A mix of lecture and hands-on projects to explore using hypermedia types as a reasonable alternative to Web APIs for building distributed hypermedia applications for the WWW.

Attendees will design a custom hypermedia type and implement simple server and client applications that support the custom type.
