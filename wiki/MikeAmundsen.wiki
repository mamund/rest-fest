|| _Level_ || Beginner/Intermediate, FiveInFive ||

|| _Title_ || *All About EVE: Extensibility, Versioning, Evolvability, etc. through Modifiability* ||
|| _Level_ || Advanced, ExtendedTalk ||
|| _Abstract_ || Fielding's dissertation points out a number of "Architectural Properties of Key Interest" (sec 2.3). One of these is "Modifiability" (sec 2.3.4) which is broken down into _Evolvability_, _Extensibility_, _Customizability_, _Configurability_, and _Reusability_. This talk reviews these "abilities" and identifies examples and strategies for achieving modifiability for distributed network applications. ||
