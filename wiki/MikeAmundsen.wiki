===Proposed Talks===
|| _Title_ || Fielding Property Maps : A Hypermedia Pattern for Resource Metadata ||
|| _Level_ || Intermediate ||
|| _ Abstract_ || Fielding once described a way to expose and manipulate a set of properties for a resource using a URI convention (similar to that used for HTML image maps) where appending ;props to a resource URI would allow clients to access any available properties for that resource. This talk demonstrates some example implementations of this simple, yet powerful hypermedia pattern. ||
