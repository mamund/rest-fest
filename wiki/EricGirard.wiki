= Introduction =

I'm working at Locweld Inc, a steel manufacturer company.  I'm responsible for any required in-house software or custom design hardware/integration.  I've been looking at REST for the last couple of years, trying to do it right!  

I love to design electronic boards & softwares.  You could say I'm an automation freak!
