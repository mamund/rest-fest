Erik Mogensen is Chief Architect of Vizrt's Online division. His claim to REST fame amounts to a talk he gave at JavaZone in 2009.  He introduced REST to his company over half a decade ago, but freely admits that his knowledge of REST [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3543075/what-is-a-concise-way-of-understanding-restful-and-its-implications/3543326#3543326 changes over time].  The last two to three years have been spent implementing a hypermedia based set of resources along with a hypermedia based client.
