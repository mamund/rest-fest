#summary CLT Shuttle Schedule and Passenger List

= Introduction =

As I can fly directly to CLT from my lovely home town (Munich, Germany), I rented a car and will make the road trip from and to Charlotte Airport. It's a [https://www.nationalcar.com/fleet.do midsize SUV from National], so if everyone travels light (just three nights, after all) I can take four passengers along.

That is good for you other attendees, as I expect airfares to CLT to be considerably cheaper than to GSP.

= When, How, Where? =

I'm flying in on the afternoon (3:35pm arrival) on the 16th, and my flight back home leaves at 5:35pm on the 19th. That means the shuttle departs CLT around 4:30pm on the 16th and departs Greenville at 2pm at the latest (a bit earlier, I guess; 1:30pm sounds reasonable) on the 19th.

*If you arrive a bit after ~4pm on the 16th, let me know, and we'll wait. If you need to catch a flight before ~5pm on the 19th, let me know, and we can depart even earlier.*

== Registration ==

Securing a spot is easy: send an email to the rest-fest list and I'll add you below. *Please include airline, flight number, any _operated byâ€¦_ codeshare information, departure/arrival time and of course the airport you are coming from and flying back to.*

== Cost ==

Free :)

= Other Shuttles =

If there's enough demand, I could probably do a later second run on the 16th and an earlier one on the 19th, but let's see if one on each day is enough first.

*However*, _you_ could also rent a car yourself and start a second shuttle in this case ;)
