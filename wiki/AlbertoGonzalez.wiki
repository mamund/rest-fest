= About Me =

Please call me Al.

I'm half owner of and software developer at Progressive Software Solutions, Inc. 

My background is pretty varied; from banking, public pay phone management, defense department contractor, custom inventory tracking solutions. Due to having to wear so many hats, my tech interests are also pretty varied.

Most of my current projects are Microsoft .NET related including Windows Forms, ASP.NET MVC and Windows Mobile/PocketPC/CE based.

Over the years I've used all of the following as my primary tools for developing business applications:

  * dBASE III, FoxPro and later Clipper (Summer '87 and 5.x)
  * Turbo Pascal and C++
  * Microsoft QuickBASIC and PDS
  * Visual Basic 3 and 5
  * Delphi
  * PowerBuilder
  * Microsoft .NET (mostly C#)
    ** Windows Forms, ASP.NET MVC and Mobile/PocketPC/CE
