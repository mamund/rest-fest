Based on [InitialAgenda](InitialAgenda.md)

  1. Keynote and session speakers selected ahead of time.
  1. Hack Room Pitches where folks stand up and suggest projects for the Hack Room
  1. Lightning talks are 5 slides/5 mins, anyone can talk, suggest pre-posting. Interesting things get a breakout session (vote w/ your feet?)
