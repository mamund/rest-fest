#### Weekend Schedule ####
http://code.google.com/p/rest-fest/wiki/Agenda

The updated schedule is posted on the Wiki. This might change hour-to-hour so keep an eye out.

#### Check-In ####
We'll have a check-in table in the main hallway starting at 7:30AM on Friday. It **may** be staffed; we might also be busy racing around getting things done[g](g.md). When you get there, you can:

  * Check yourself off the Check-in List
  * Grab a badge & decorate it as you see fit
  * Help yourself to any swag that's there
  * Wander off to the Snacks & Drinks table

#### Friday Hypermedia Workshop ####
http://www.restfest.org/schedule/workshop

If you signed up for the Hypermedia Hacking workshop, be sure to bring your laptop and be prepared to code. This is really going to be a "workshop." Also, there is a lot to cover so the session will kick off right at 8AM. Be ready!

Friday will also be a lot like a "Master Class" where you can show your work and get feedback. If you are already working on a media type, a RESTful project that uses a custom type, or are just in the planning stages, bring whatever you have and we can review it.

The workshop will include authoring a media type and working on either server or client code (depending your preference). There will be more than one existing live application available serving up both simple API and rich media-type responses. You'll have a chance to write both clients and servers against these data servers!

#### Friday Evening Keynote ####
http://www.restfest.org/speakers

Glenn Block, of Microsoft, will be doing the keynote on Friday night @ 7:30. His working title is "Embracing HTTP in the .NET platform - Have it your way!" From what I can tell, Glenn's team is "baking HTTP into the .NET runtime" and he should have some intersting perspectives on HTTP & REST to share with everyone.

The keynote will be followed by some time to talk about any Hack Room projects for the weekend and then some refreshments and a chance socialize.

#### Saturday Speakers ####
http://code.google.com/p/rest-fest/wiki/People

Remember, at RESTFest, everyone is a speaker! Be sure to have your slides ready ahead of time (like minutes ahead, maybe?). The FiveInFive talks will all be given off the same laptop so they should be available electronically. It might be a linux box, so be prepared.

Best thing to do is save your slides as a PDF online and link to them to your profile in the Wiki. You can also use the shared RESTFest folder in Google Docs (you should have already recieved an email on this) as your online location for the PDF and use the published link.

NOTE: A few attendees have yet to post their talk abstracts on the Wiki (you know who you are - we all do!). We want to be sure everyone has a slot available. Please post your abstracts as soon as you can (a title is all that's needed) so we can arrange the talks
in an interesting order(LOL). BTW, if you don't post one, you can count on one of us calling out your name when an open slot is available!

#### Food & Drink ####
We'll be supplying lunch both days. Friday will be a "working lunch" w/ pizza brought in. Saturday will be boxed lunches from a local restaraunt. We'll have coffee, tea, soft drinks, & snacks available starting in the AM and throughout the day. If we fall behind on making a fresh pot of coffee just let someone know (@mamund, @bigbluehat, @danAbend). You're on your own for breakfast and dinner.

#### Internet Access ####
We will have access to the public Wi-Fi in the Greenville NEXT Center. Hopefully it will be responsive. It's possible that things will get a bit sluggish during the day. We'll cope, right?

#### Twitter Away ####
Feel free to tweet away during the event. @RESTFest is the official account and #RESTFest is the official hash tag. All comments are welcome.
Also, @RESTFest maintains a list of Attendees and Sponsors. If your handle is not on the list, let @mamund or @bigbluehat know and we'll be sure to add you.
